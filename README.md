# PythonNewtBox
An N-body orbital simulator written in Python. Created in 2025.  

My series of "NewtBox" (or Newton Sandbox) simulations are Newtonian N-body orbital simulators I use to learn a new language. I find reimplementing a familar project is a good way to get a grasp on an unfamiliar language.  

This is an exception; rather, it is a portfolio piece. A problem of using a project like this to learn a new language is that one has yet to understand the intent behind the languages choices. As such, my NewtBoxes are rough around the edges since at their creation I had yet to master their languages. Now that I have learned much about Python, I want to showcase some better practices.
